This is a little mod(really little) to enable Bluetooth HID profile on Android devices that has at least android 9
,Android 10 Xiaomi devices has it enabled by default (at least on my phone)
before installing this i recommend to check your device compatibility here https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rdapps.bluetoothhidtester&hl=en,because you don't need to use this if your device has already it enabled
,Also its under testing,so idk if this works for your device

I have opened it to all pie based devices if want to try it(also if it doesn't work make an issue here with your device model and name and I'll try to add it in the compatibility list),but dont blame me if something goes wrong (even if this should be secure)

<h>Before testing please do a buckup of everything</h>

OnePlus user could have some problems enabling HID support,some suggested to change their ROM to lineageOS
