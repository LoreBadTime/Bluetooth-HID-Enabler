This is a little modn to enable Bluetooth HID profile on Android devices that have at least android 9

Before installing this i recommend to check your device compatibility here https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rdapps.bluetoothhidtester&hl=en,because you don't need to use this if your device has already it enabled,also this its under testing,so idk if this works for your device,so dont blame me if something goes wrong (even if this should be secure),its advised to do a backup of your system bluetooth apk.

# Before usding this,please do a backup of everything

OnePlus user could have some problems enabling HID support,some suggested to change their ROM to lineageOS
